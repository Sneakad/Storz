## Fluence P2P File Sharing Demo

This is a prototype of how we can share files using Fluence relay from one browser to another.
To demonstrate the working of the peer-to-peer file sharing feature , as of now we are just sending a text message from one browser to another using Fluence relay.

⚠️The development is still in progress.
